# Franka Emika PANDA Setup

This repository is documentation for setting up the FCI interface for the Franka Panda Emika (version specifics in [setup.md](setup.md)). I went through a lot of pain setting everything up, so I documented everything here so hopefully I save my future self pain if I have to do this again.

If you want to just setup libfranka, instructions are in [libfranka_only/README.md](libfranka_only/README.md).

If you want to setup libfranka to work with ROS 1 Noetic using franka_ros, the instructions are in [ros_noetic/README.md](ros_noetic/README.md). These instructions have you setup everything using a container (so they should theoretically be easier than the default Franka Emika installation instructions). If you want to setup everything from scratch on your machine, you can also follow  [setup.md](setup.md).


If anyone else happens to use this repo and runs into issues, feel free to create an issue and I'll try to help as best I can!
